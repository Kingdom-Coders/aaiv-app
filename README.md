## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

1. Go to the **Kingdom Coders Slack**.
2. Navigate to the `#env` channel.
3. Copy the contents provided in the channel.
4. In the root of your project (where `README.md` is), create a new file named `.env`.
5. Paste the copied contents into the `.env` file and save it.

**Note:** The Google Calendar integration is already set up by administrators - you don't need to configure anything extra! üéâ

## Step 3: Install Dependencies and Start the Project

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
npm i  # Install backend packages
cd frontend  # Go into the frontend folder
npm i  # Install frontend packages
cd ..  # Go back to the root folder
npm run dev  # Start the server and website
```

Once you run these commands, the website should open in your browser! Try registering and logging in and browsing through the website!

## üóìÔ∏è Google Calendar Integration

### For Users (Super Easy!)

The Google Calendar feature is ready to use! Simply:

1. **Click the "Connect Google Calendar" button** anywhere in the app
2. **Sign in with your Google account** when prompted
3. **Grant permission** for Kingdom Coders to access your calendar
4. **Done!** ‚úÖ Your calendar is now connected

**That's it!** No setup, no configuration files, no Google Cloud Console - just click and connect!

### How It Works

- **One-Click Connection**: Click the button and authorize with Google
- **Secure**: Uses industry-standard OAuth 2.0 for security
- **Personal**: Only you can see your calendar events
- **Seamless**: Works in a popup window, no page redirects
- **Smart**: Remembers your connection across sessions

### Features Available

Once connected, you can:
- ‚úÖ View your upcoming Google Calendar events
- ‚úÖ See event details (time, location, description)
- ‚úÖ Beautiful, mobile-friendly calendar interface
- ‚úÖ Disconnect anytime with one click

### Troubleshooting

**"Google Calendar Integration Not Available"**
- The feature is being set up by administrators
- Check back later or contact support

**Connection Issues**
- Make sure you're signed into Google in your browser
- Try clearing browser cookies and reconnecting
- Ensure popup blockers aren't preventing the authorization window

**Still Having Issues?**
- Contact **David** or **Collin** for help
- Check the `#support` channel in Slack

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Port Conflicts**: If port 5001 is in use, the server will fail to start. Change the PORT in your `.env` file
- **Database Connection**: Ensure your MongoDB connection string is correct in the `.env` file
- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in both root and frontend directories
