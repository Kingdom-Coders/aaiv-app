# Task 6: Create Confirmation Modal Component

## üéØ Objective
Create a reusable confirmation modal component for actions that require user confirmation (like deleting posts, leaving groups, etc.).

## üìã Requirements
- Create a new `ConfirmationModal.js` component in `frontend/src/components/`
- Display a modal overlay with a confirmation message
- Include "Confirm" and "Cancel" buttons with customizable text
- Support different types of confirmations (delete, warning, info)
- Make the modal accessible and keyboard-friendly
- Add smooth open/close animations

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create the Modal Structure
1. Navigate to `frontend/src/components/`
2. Create `ConfirmationModal.js` and `ConfirmationModal.css`
3. Create a modal with overlay, content area, and button section

### Step 2: Implement Modal Functionality
1. Accept props for `isOpen`, `onConfirm`, `onCancel`
2. Add props for customizable title, message, and button text
3. Implement click-outside-to-close functionality
4. Add escape key to close functionality

### Step 3: Add Different Modal Types
1. Support types: 'delete' (red), 'warning' (yellow), 'info' (blue)
2. Apply different colors and icons based on type
3. Set appropriate default messages for each type

### Step 4: Style the Modal
1. Create a semi-transparent overlay
2. Center the modal content
3. Add smooth fade-in/fade-out animations
4. Make it responsive for mobile devices
5. Ensure good contrast and readability

### Step 5: Add Accessibility Features
1. Trap focus within the modal when open
2. Add proper ARIA attributes
3. Ensure keyboard navigation works
4. Return focus to trigger element when closed

## üí° Hints
- Use `position: fixed` for the overlay to cover the entire screen
- Use `z-index` to ensure the modal appears above other content
- Look at existing button styles in the app for consistency
- Consider using `useEffect` to handle escape key events
- Test the modal with different message lengths
